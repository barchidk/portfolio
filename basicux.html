        <h1>BASIC UX</h1>
        <p>The last theme of the semester, Basic UX, thaught me to think from the perspective of the user. We conducted interviews in order to enhance our prototypes and I definitely enjoyed that very much. It's very interesting for me to watch the user and discuss the potential features that would make the website or application friedlier. </p>

                <h2>04.01.01 - Design Sprint</h2>
                <p>The design sprint worked up a final idea for the enhanced version of Fronter. We had to break down what to keep and what to cut out of the mobile application in order to make it as user friendly and attractive for the students as possible</p>
